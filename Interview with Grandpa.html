  <h2>Interview With My Grandpa</h2>
</section>

  <div class="body">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you registered to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Yes, I am.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are you registered to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Because I think that that is a privilege that must be carried out by all Americans.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> When was the first time you registered to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> 1976 Election.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What made you register to vote then?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I wanted to vote for Jimmy Carter because I was sick of all the crap from the Republicans, and the Nixon administration. And the post-Nixon administration, too. Although, the president after Nixon was a very nice man. Gerald Ford.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did anyone go with you the first time you went to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I voted absentee ballot, because I was in school and I voted in Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How often have you voted in your life?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Every election since then, and primaries too, except the last primary in 2021 when I was living in Pennsylvania. They decided to send me the ballot 3 days after the primary was over. I nevertheless voted, and sent it in, and I said to them, “I have never missed a vote in my life, and I'm not gonna miss this one. Even if it doesn't count.” The thing is, that area was a Republican area and, to vote, I had to declare that I was a Democrat. So they didn't let me vote.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What topics often drive you to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> The economy, immigration, individual rights, including women’s rights because I've only had a daughter and a granddaughter. I'm definitely a feminist. And my sister is my sibling I get along best with, although she's kinda crazy these days.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Has there ever been anything that's made you want to vote less?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> No, I feel that it's a duty to vote and when things get bad with the MAGA movement here in the United States, I think it's imperative I get out and vote so that I don't have to live under another dictatorship a 3rd time in my life. I’ve already lived under two, I don't want to live under a third one. How ’bout them apples?</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think other people should be more involved in voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I think everybody should be involved in voting.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you think we can encourage people to vote more?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> It depends who the people are. It's important to talk to them about the policies that matter on both sides of the spectrum. So that people can understand better what's going on. For example, I don't understand how anyone can even think of supporting Trump. It's beyond me. They don't seem to care about the policies. They're just looking at somebody with some kind of charismatic appeal, to them. Not to me—the guy's disgusting. The way he treats people. The way he talks to people. His policies are for the rich and for himself.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can we encourage Latino people to vote more?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> It's important to inform them about the situation under each one of the parties. You have to put a list of what would be positive for the Latino voter for the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. They have to understand what's at stake if they vote against their own interests.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can we communicate with the Latino community without implicating our own bias?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Definitely appeal to them in their own language—bilingually. I think that would be best. Put “Vota” at the top and “Vote.” at the bottom.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you think Latino people statistically vote more?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Because many Latino voters don't get a real choice when they're in their home country. I'm talking about those who came over, like me, from countries in Latin America and became naturalized citizens. I think it's wonderful that Latino voters tend to vote more. I just hope they’re better informed about what they're voting for.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do younger Latino people vote more than older ones?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Older ones may be more afraid to get out there. Younger ones—especially those born in the United States—grew up in an atmosphere of democracy. They're more exposed to it, and they go to school here.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think there's something most Latinos understand about voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> They need to pay attention to the voting laws being passed. In red states, voting laws are being passed to disenfranchise people. Blue states try to make it easier. They need to understand that. And they need to understand that if they're American citizens, voting is both a privilege and a duty.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do so many people understand voting as important?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Because of the education here in the U.S. A lot of young Latinos in Latin America can't get a decent education because they have to work. Here at least they can go to school for free.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What should I watch out for as a white person when advertising to the Latino community?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Make sure you aren't condescending. Thank them for what they’ve brought to the United States and for their work. And remind them that it's their right to vote.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What challenges have you or others struggled with when trying to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> People need to understand exactly how a ballot works. And they need identification. Some may not have the correct identification, and we should help them get one.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do those education gaps exist?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Older Latino voters might not have had the opportunity to be educated the way a citizen should be. We need to make sure they understand the process—not frighten them with laws meant to make it harder to vote.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do people think Latinos vote less?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Some might be afraid to vote, especially if they just arrived or recently became citizens. But I'm not sure the idea that Latinos don't vote is even true.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do people think younger Latinos aren't involved in voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I have no idea, because that's not true. Younger Latinos do vote—they make sure their vote counts.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can we communicate that Latinos are highly involved in voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Point out the facts. Research. Be informed.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What symbols would represent the Latino community?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I’m not sure there’s one symbol. But I’d put a big American flag with all the Latin American flags around it. Maybe an American eagle. And something like “You have a voice—let your voice be heard.”</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What colors should I use?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Red, white, and blue. Also the colors from the various Latin American flags.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What should I avoid?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Anything derogatory or stereotypical. No bananas, no tacos—nothing like that.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What voting advertisements do you remember most?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Posters with the candidates’ names. “Make your vote count.”</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What about older voting ads?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Pins, stickers, little flags. Collectible things.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do we get older people’s attention?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Appeal to their age—like Social Security and Medicare.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What tone should we aim for?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Make sure people understand it. Don’t talk down to them, but don’t talk over their heads.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where should the posters be placed?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Along streets where people drive by, and maybe community centers. Ask permission if it’s a church.</p>
