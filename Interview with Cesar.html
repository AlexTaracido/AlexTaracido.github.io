  <h1>Interview with Cesar</h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you registered to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are you registered to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I feel like that should be an easy one to come to terms with. It’s pushed very hard, especially going into college and even leaving high school. “You need to register to vote.” It's a path to life. It's something that you can't just not do, especially in this day and age being so young with social media. We’re being told left and right, every corner you take and every two inches you scroll, you're being told to go vote. Go vote. Go vote.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think people should be more involved in voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I think they should. I think you should have your voice be heard for the opinion you have. But also, not let yourself get caught up in what other people want you to think—to the point where you let their opinion impact what you do.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you think some people aren’t as involved in voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Because they think their vote doesn’t count, especially if they have really unpopular opinions about what they believe some laws should say. “Oh, I don't want to vote because I think abortion should be XYZ,” or, “This topic I'm fond of isn't included in the two parties.”</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> The end goal of this research is to create a poster for the community. How do you think we can address that problem through the poster?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Especially if you're trying to target the Latino community, use the language of the people you're targeting, but also market toward family-oriented and religious ideals. I don't think you'd be swaying to either side by bringing religion or family into it—especially used in their language. Like, “Vote for what you want.”  
    <br><em>(Interviewer reassures him.)</em><br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Yeah, exactly. You aren't going to try to inform people in Mandarin and make the poster in English. Do more research about the specific community—like religion in Mexico. Muslim family values? You’d write in Arabic. Catholics hold family near and dear, and religion is persistent. Market it with something like “God wants you to vote.”</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How often do you vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I'm going to be honest with you, I've never voted before.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> So this is your first year voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Yes, this would be my first year. I turned 18 in 2021 and wasn't old enough for the first election. And in the most recent election—governors, between Abbott and Beto—I didn’t vote either. I didn't want to vote for someone just because I was being told to. I didn’t feel like I came to the decision myself. Instead, it was just social media: “Vote for him! Vote for him!” I also don't like being told what to do…but that's only a slight part of it *laughs*.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there someone in your life who encourages you to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Not necessarily. It’s not a big thing in my family—no “who are you voting for?” Politics isn’t big in our household, unlike some families where bringing up healthcare or abortion leads to arguments. I fortunately didn’t grow up with that.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> My research shows the Latino community has the highest percentage of voters, especially young voters. Why do you think that is?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I think it has a lot to do with social media. Younger voters are coming of age. And in the Latino community, it's stereotypical to want to go vote because your parents can’t. So you take that in—“My parents can’t vote so I’m going to.” Many come from immigrant families, undocumented families, work visas, etc. It’s pushed on younger people. You get the path I’m taking.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do younger Latino people vote more than older ones?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> It’s basically that younger people have the ability to vote—older ones sometimes don’t because of documentation status. In some states you don’t need voter ID, but that’s a whole other topic.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think most Latinos can agree on when it comes to voting?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Politicians aren’t your friends. In Mexico, it’s widely known. They’re put into positions of power for their own benefit. Recently, the president of Mexico got elected, but 34 candidates were assassinated. It’s different, but it shows the distrust. Every once in a while you’ll get a politician who does good—but most are there for themselves.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I, as a white person, communicate respectfully to Latinos in the poster?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Do NOT use the term “Latinx.” That's like a slur. Spanish is a gendered language. If you call someone “Latinx,” they'll look at you like you just insulted them.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you feel about the process of registering to vote?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> It’s easy. Not too difficult as long as you have some time.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Has it ever been difficult for you?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Not at all.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What tone should I use when communicating this material?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Latinos are very family-oriented and religious. But politically it becomes complicated. A lot of conservative values align with Latino values—family, religion, country. But their backgrounds and life experiences can push them Democratic. It’s 50/50 depending on where and how you grew up. Everything in your life shifts your perspective.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I remain respectful when using Spanish in the poster?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Don’t use “Latinx.” And don’t be afraid to try—some people will dislike it no matter what. Aim for the option that gets the least people to hate you. Push family and push religion: Christianity, Catholicism.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> There’s a misconception that young Latino people aren’t involved in voting. Why do you think that is?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I really wouldn’t know.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What symbols represent the Latino community as a whole?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> That’s tough. We’re talking about most of South America, Portugal, Spain. I keep imagining the Lord holding a cross with Spanish text—something religious. Religion is a big one.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What colors represent the Latino community?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Green, white, and red. And I love the Mexican eagle with the snake and cactus. Mexico has the most beautiful flag in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What voting advertisements do you remember?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> The 2020 presidential election and the 2022 governor election. Everywhere I looked—“Vote for Abbott,” “Vote for Beto”—stickers, signs, pins.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was memorable about them?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> The sheer amount. You couldn’t go a mile without seeing dozens of ads.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can we effectively reach the Latino community when placing our poster?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Depends where you are. Billboards along I-35—since it runs from Laredo up. Road signs, yard signs.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where would you feel comfortable seeing the poster?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Billboards along major highways. I wouldn’t put them at businesses—you don’t want people to get sick of political ads.</p>
